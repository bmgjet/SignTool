<h2>SignTool</h2>
<p>Embeds sign images and skin data into MapData,<br />Loads sign images and skin data from MapData,<br />Scales prefabs to there RustEdit Settings <em>(<strong>Requires <a href="https://umod.org/plugins/entity-scale-manager" target="_blank">Entity Scale Manager</a> for this function.</strong>)</em><br /><br /><strong>Permissions:</strong><br />SignTool.admin</p>
<p><strong>ChatCommand:</strong><br />/mapsave (Saves a new version of the map in server root with data embeded)<br />/sskin skinid (Applys skinid to entity being looked at)<br />/ssign (url or base64) (Applys image to sign being looked at)<br />/sscale float (Scales entity <em>(<strong>Requires <a href="https://umod.org/plugins/entity-scale-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entity Scale Manager</a> for this function.</strong>))</em><br /><br /><strong>How to use:</strong><br />Create a map in rust edit with some of the signs and/or entitys that can be skinned.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(*Neons are broken and will freeze the server on boot)</span><br />You can use this windows GUI tool to add images and skins to the MapData without having to run it on a server.<br /><a href="https://github.com/bmgjet/SignToolsGUI">https://github.com/bmgjet/SignToolsGUI</a><br /><br />Or start a server with that map.<br />Add images, skins and scale things as wanted using the commands.<br />Use command /mapsave.<br />It will create a new map file in the root dir of your rust server.<br />Rename it as you wish.<br /><br />Running this map with the plugin installed will auto load the signs,skins and scale.<br />Opening the map again in rust edit will delete them.<br />So its recommended to use the SignToolsGUI first to export the settings.<br />Then Import it again after any changes in Rust Edit have been made.<br /><br /><strong>Note:<br /></strong>Object are identified by there position. Moving them in Rust Edit will remove there data.<br />Scaling of objects should have X,Y,Z all set the same in Rust Edit.<br />Scaling is handled by Entity Scale Manager. Its not perfect.<br /><br /></p>
